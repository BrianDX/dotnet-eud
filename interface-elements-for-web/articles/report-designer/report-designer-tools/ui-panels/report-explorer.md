# Report Explorer
The **Report Explorer** shows a report's structure in a tree-like form providing easy access to report elements. Additionally, the **Report Explorer** contains the **Components** node, which displays non-visual report components, such as data objects created when binding a report to a data source.

The following actions are available for report element customization:

| Button | Description |
|---|---|
| ![](../../../../images/eurd-web-fieldlist-data-source-edit-relationships.png) | Switches to the [Properties Panel](properties-panel.md) where you can adjust the selected report element's or the entire report's settings. |
| ![](../../../../images/eurd-web-fieldlist-data-source-delete.png) | Removes the selected report element. This button is not available for the **Detail**, **TopMargin**, and **BottomMargin** bands. |

You can use drag-and-drop operations to do the following in the Report Explorer:

* Reorder report controls and specific bands.
