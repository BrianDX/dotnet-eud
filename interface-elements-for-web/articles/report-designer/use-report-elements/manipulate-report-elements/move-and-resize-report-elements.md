You can also [select multiple controls](select-report-elements-and-access-their-settings.md) and move them in the same way as individual report controls.

Select a control and then drag a rectangle drawn on its edge or corner to resize it.

You can use the **Size to Grid** button to resize a control to the report's **Snap Grid**.
